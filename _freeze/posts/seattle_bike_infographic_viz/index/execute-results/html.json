My goals of this infographic were to quantify the general number of bikes on the road in Seattle, compare bike usage across six different bike counting locations, and look into seasonal biking trends. In order to do this, I utilized data from Data.Seattle.gov. [^1] I specifically utilized 6 different data sets that are all analogous in structure, but each for a different location. Each dataset contains four columns: the date, the number of bikes counted that were travelling northbound, the number of bikes counted that were travelling southbound, and the total number of bikes counted (the northbound column + the southbound column). The date column includes hourly data, so each observation in the dataset is a date and an individual hour. When I aggregated the six different locations into one data set, I added a column to specify the location, and removed the north and south bound columns.]{.custom-montserrat-text}\n\n[^1]: Seattle Department of Transportation. (2023). Bike Counters. https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bike-program/bike-counters\n\nTo achieve the goals stated above, I created three different visualizations to include in my infographic. I first created a bar plot to show the total number of bikes counted in my aggregated dataset for each year (2014-2020). I also created an area graph that shows the total number of bikes counted monthly at each of the six different locations. Unlike the bar plot, this graph takes month and location into consideration. The third plot I created was a heatmap that aims to look at trends both monthly and yearly. I hoped that this plot could reveal any potential global warming trends- i.e. did biking start to become less popular in June as years progressed?\n\nWhen creating these plots, I made many different considerations to implement my design. The first decision I made was which types of plots I would use to convey each of my goals. I decided on a bar plot for the yearly total number of bikes counted because it easily conveyed the differences among the years. I used an area plot specifically for the monthly data as I wanted to visualize how usage varies from location to location. This graph also allowed me to see if certain locations were more popular in certain months than others- for example, were bike trails more popular in summer than a busy street? Finally, I decided on a heatmap to visualize how bike usage changed across both month and year because the different tiles make the count of bikes digestable with a continuous color scale. On all these plots, I made updates to the plot titles. In the case of the bar plot, I removed the title all together and utilized annotations instead. To remove extra clutter, I removed every other x axis tick mark (month) in the area plot. I updated the font for all plots to be consistent with the infographic title font. I made these updates in the `theme()` layer of each plot. Other updates to the `theme()` layer include adjusting the margins of the legend, rotating the legend (for the heatmap), increasing legend size (for the heatmap and area plot), and updating the size of x and y axis tick marks/ labels (all three plots).\n\nWhen arranging the elements in my infographic, I considered many different options to get my message across in a clean and concise way that was not visually overwhelming. I wanted my area plot and bar plot to be near each other, towards the bottom of the plot. I wanted these two plots to represent land type objects (the area plot a mountain, and the bar plot to be city buildings). I wanted them towards the bottom so they looked more grounded and didn't represent a floating mountain/ buildings. Because of this, I placed the heatmap toward the top of the map. To eliminate too much text and blank space, I also added a space needle building image. I broke up the text into smaller chunks and spread them out to avoid paragraphs of text. In order to contextualize my data, I added a paragraph that provided a bit of background on the data itself and when it started to be collected. I also provided average annual and monthly temperatures via text boxes to allow viewers to contextualize what the temperatures might be when they see peaks and valleys of bike counts, both yearly and monthly. The central message that I wanted to get across was that time of year/ temperature played a large role in the number of bikers that were counted. I made this the central message not only through my plots, but also through the text and annotations that incorporated temperature in relation to each of the three plots.\n\nOnce I decided on the current color palette, I used color blind simulator to see if the palette I chose was color friendly. The color palette I chose was centered around differentiating the different locations in my area plot, and these differences were still clear among all color deficiencies. Before creating my infographic, I used a DEI lens by looking into the different locations that the bike sensors were implemented to see if they were in only wealthy neighborhoods that would likely count more bikes. The bike locations came from different road types (i.e. bike pathways, public roads, etc.) and were not privy to any certain area.\n\nI have included all code to my three different visualizations below! All plots were generated using `ggplot()` and I used `magick()` to add these plots together create an infographic. Because I wanted to add on a few more compelx graphic design elements that could not be completed in R, I downloaded a png of my base infographic, and added some finishing touches in Canva. I hope you enjoy exploring my infographic and code below!\n\n## Seattle Bike Count Infographic\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::
