### Hi there! Welcome to my website!

My name is Annie Adams! After receiving my Master of Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in June of 2024, I just couldn't stay away! I am now working as a lecturer in the Master of Environmental Data Science program, helping to develop coursework and teach the next cohort of environmental data scientists! When I am not behind a computer, I love to hike, cycle, explore new countries, and bikepack! Check out the rest of my website to learn more about me and see what I have been up to!
